2. As the program prints out statements to the terminal, append those lines to the corresponding output terminal log in ExpectedOutputs -> TerminalLog
3. Route any output files to the OutputFiles directory, naming them ‘#’ (corresponding to test case)
4. Compare each line in expected terminal log and actual terminal log
5. Compare the outputted files
